# To Create Dialogue Levels:

# Step1: Create Scene identically to "Level_00Pre.tcsn" DO NOT ATTACH SCRIPTS
# Step2: On the "DialogueBox" Control Node, hit attach script, and make the new script
# ^^^^^ this will allow you to access $richtextlabels and stuff. 
# Step3: Copy "Level_00Pre.gd" to the new .gd script.
# Step4: Make a new .gd script and copy the contents of "Level_00PreButton.gd" to this new script.
# Step5: If you did this right and it works, you just saved three hours of wondering why it wasnt finding $richtextlabels
